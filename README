	     /\----------------------------------------------/\

This is a suite of programs to generate, display and analyse complex 
visibilities obtained from the Phase-I 40-element interferometer and 
Phase-II 264-element interferometer for the Ooty Radio Telescope(ORT).
Besides, there are routines to solve for the complex antenna gains 
and the unknown true visibilties.       

To build:
---------

1. After untar-ing the package, you must see a directory "Prowess". 
   Change to directory "Prowess". 

2. The build directory contains the directories "opt", "cfitsio", "src", 
   "inc", "lib", "doc" and "bin". Besides, it has a "README"(this file), 
   the ASCII files "Project.Par"  and "Antenna.Def", the shell script 
   "RC.sh", and the "Makefile". 

3. The contents of the directory should, for example, look like this:

	drwxr-xr-x 5 user user 4.0K Mar 27 15:15 opt
	drwxr-xr-x 2 user user  12K Mar 27 15:15 cfitsio
	drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Mar 27 15:15 src
	drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Mar 27 15:16 inc
	drwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4.0K Mar 27 15:16 lib
	drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Mar 27 15:16 doc
	drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Mar 27 15:16 bin
	-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 2.5K Mar 27 15:16 README
	-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1.4K Mar 27 15:16 Project.Par
	-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1.6K Mar 27 15:16 Antenna.Def.40
	-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1.6K Mar 27 15:16 Antenna.Def.264
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 1.2K Mar 27 15:16 RC.sh
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 1.2K Mar 27 15:16 Makefile

4. Now, at the prompt, run "source RC.sh". If the cfitsio libraries are
   not present in "lib/", it compiles the cfitsio programs and puts the 
   static and shared object libraries in "lib/", and copies the cfitsio 
   header files to "inc/". However, once the cfitsio libraries are available
   in "lib/", it avoids recompilation of cfitsio. It similarly checks for the
   opt library "lib/libopt.a" and, if not found, copies it from "opt/lib" 
   to "lib/". It also sets the environment variables required by the programs. 

5. You are ready to run "make" at the prompt. Once "make" runs successfully, 
   the executable program should be available in the "bin" directory. Run 
   "make clean" optionally to remove intermediate *.o files. 
   Run "make CFLAGS=-D_NO_VERBOSE" to force the non-verbose mode.

6. It is recommended that the binaries from "bin/" are copied to, or a 
   symbolic link to the executables is provided in, your "/home/user/bin" 
   area.

7. Note: If you have not installed atlas/LAPACK in your default area, you
   should change the following line in Makefile as instructed:

   From : GSLLIB  = -lgsl -lptcblas -latlas
     To : GSLLIB  = -lgsl -lgslcblas
