Usage : plotmodl -i InputFITSmap (or) *.model 
-------		 -m 0/1 for ampl-phase / real-imag, default 0.
		 -d default x/X for Xwindow, p/P for postscript.

	"plotmodl --help" for self-explanatory documentation.

plotmodl: Plots the model visibilities in the *.model file or the
	  FITS map. For the FITS map, the program computes the 
	  model visibility for each baseline as a superposed sum of
	  the contribution from each pixel. It then plots the 
	  computed model visibilities, by default in amplitude and
	  phase. The X Window is toggle enabled to display real-
	  imaginary or amplitude-phase. It can be overridden to 
	  display real-imaginary in the first place by passing -m 1.
	  The model visibilities can also be written to a postscript
	  file. Here again, the argument passed with the -m switch 
	  decides whether the the aplitude-phase or real-imaginary
	  is written to the postscript file.
