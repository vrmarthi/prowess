This is a suite of programs to generate, display and analyse complex 
visibilities obtained from the Phase-I 40-element interferometer and 
Phase-II 264-element interferometer for the Ooty Radio Telescope(ORT).
Besides, there are routines to solve for the complex antenna gains 
and the unknown true visibilties.
