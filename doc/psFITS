psFITS:  Generates UV FITS data for a single point source(a calibrator, 
	 for example) observed with the Ooty Radio Telescope. The program 
	 generates visibilities for the Phase-I configuration of 40 antennas
	 or the Phase-II configuration of 264 antennas. One has to copy 
	 either of the antenna configuration definition files "Antenna.Def.40" 
	 or "Antenna.Def.264" to "Antenna.Def", which is the default antenna 
	 configuration definition file that psFITS expects. Antennas can be 
	 switched off by commenting the corresponding lines in "Antenna.Def"
	 with a "#".

	 Although it generates the auxiliary files "ant-init.info" and 
	 "baselines.info", it does not write a FITS map of the sky being 
	 observed. Omitting the argument for the "-t" option, similar to
	 "genFITS" produces a UVFITS files with the proper extension tables
	 but without any random group record. The "Antenna.Def" and 
	 "Project.Par" files have to be available in the working directory.
	 Refer to the documentation on "genFITS" for details of the "Project.Par"
	 file.
